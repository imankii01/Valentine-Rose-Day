```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Love Story App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
        import { createRoot } from "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client";
        import React from "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0";
        import App from "./app.js";  // Create app.js with your React code
        createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(React.createElement(App));
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **Step 2: Create `app.js`**
- Copy your React component code into `app.js`
